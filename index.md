## About Me

My name is Aidan Dalgarno-Platt. While I'm originally from Scotland, I went to high school in Upper Dublin, PA, just outside Philadelphia. Besides coding, I play a lot of video games. Beyond that, I just float around whatever takes my fancy. I've done a bit of writing, video editing, music production, etc, but I'm not really good at any of it.
